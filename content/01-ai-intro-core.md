# AI Intro Core Notes

## 1) What are AI, ML, and Deep Learning?

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the broad field of building systems that perform tasks we consider "intelligent" (reasoning, perception, generation, decision-making).
- **Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of AI where systems learn patterns from data instead of being fully hand-programmed.
- **Deep Learning (DL)** is a subset of ML based on neural networks with many layers, especially effective for images, language, and audio.

In practice:

- AI is the umbrella term
- ML is the dominant modern approach
- DL powers many current creative AI tools

## 2) Core Vocabulary You Should Know

- **Model**: a mathematical system that maps inputs to outputs
- **Training data**: examples used to teach the model
- **Training**: process of adjusting model parameters to fit patterns in data
- **Inference**: using a trained model to produce outputs for new inputs
- **Generalization**: how well a model performs on unseen examples
- **Bias**: systematic skew in data or model behavior
- **Evaluation**: measuring performance with defined criteria

## 3) A Very Short Historical Timeline

- **1950s–60s**: Early AI ideas (symbolic AI, perceptron)
- **1970s–80s**: AI winters (reduced funding/expectations)
- **1990s–2000s**: Statistical ML grows with more data and compute
- **2010s**: Deep learning breakthroughs in vision and language
- **2020s**: Foundation models and generative AI enter mainstream creative workflows

Key point: progress is not linear. AI development moves in cycles of hype, correction, and new breakthroughs.

## 4) AI in Art and Design

Common use cases:

- Ideation and moodboard generation
- Visual style exploration and variation
- Text generation for concepts, titles, and copy drafts
- Audio and video prototyping
- Coding assistance for creative tools and interactive projects

Common limitations:

- Hallucinations and factual errors
- Inconsistent style/control
- Dataset bias and representation issues
- Copyright, attribution, and authorship concerns
- Environmental and infrastructure costs

As a creative practitioner, your value is not only prompt-writing, but **critical framing**, **curation**, **editing**, and **ethical decision-making**.

## 5) Suggested Workflow for This Class

1. Start from a clear creative intent
2. Use AI tools for divergence (many options quickly)
3. Curate and evaluate outputs against your intent
4. Refine with iteration and constraints
5. Document process, sources, and decisions

## 6) Reflection Questions

- Where does AI save time in your current workflow?
- Where does AI reduce quality or originality?
- What should remain fully human in your process?
- How will you communicate tool usage and authorship transparently?
