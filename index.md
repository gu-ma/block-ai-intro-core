# Block: AI – Intro Core

This block introduces core concepts in artificial intelligence and machine learning with a focus on creative practice. Students build shared vocabulary, understand key historical milestones, and learn how current AI systems are used (and misused) in art and design workflows.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this block, you will be able to:

- Explain the differences between AI, machine learning, and deep learning in simple terms
- Describe major moments in the evolution of modern AI
- Identify practical use cases and limitations of AI in art and design
- Use core terms (model, training data, inference, bias, generalization) correctly in discussion

## Content Overview

- **Slides:**
  - [presentation](#)
  - Slides are managed in separate repos.

- **Content:**
  - [AI Intro Core Notes](./content/01-ai-intro-core.md)

- **Resources:**
  - Local resources folder: [`resources/`](./resources/)
  - Optional books and references are available in the historical reference block (`temp/compp_f2501/.../block-ai-intro-core/resources`)

- **Samples:**
  - Sample notebooks or demos can be added in [`samples/`](./samples/)
