# Block: AI – Intro Core

This block introduces core concepts in artificial intelligence and machine learning with a focus on creative practice. Students build shared vocabulary, understand key historical milestones, and learn how current AI systems are used (and misused) in art and design workflows.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this block, you will be able to:

- Explain the differences between AI, machine learning, and deep learning in simple terms
- Describe major moments in the evolution of modern AI
- Identify practical use cases and limitations of AI in art and design
- Use core terms (model, training data, inference, bias, generalization) correctly in discussion

## Session Timeline Overview

- **Part 1 (Lecture + Discussion, ~45–60 min):**
  - AI vs ML vs Deep Learning
  - Short historical timeline
  - Use cases, limitations, and ethics in art/design workflows
- **Part 2 (Hands-on Lab, ~60–75 min):**
  - Jupyter/Colab onboarding
  - Notebook fundamentals and first ML interaction
- **Debrief (10 min):**
  - Reflection on black-box behavior, limits, and creative use

## Part 1: Concepts + History

**Format:** Online presentation

- **Slides:**
  - [presentation](https://digitalideation.github.io/digcre_h2401/slides/intro_part01.html)
- **Core notes:**
  - [AI Intro Core Notes](content/01-ai-intro-core.md)

## Part 2: Notebook Onboarding (Jupyter/Colab)

**Format:** Guided hands-on lab (60–75 min)

### Session Flow

1. **Framing (5–10 min)**
   - What a notebook is: text + code + output
   - Position notebooks as a creative lab notebook (process + experiments + reflection)
2. **Guided setup (10 min)**
   - Open shared Colab notebook and save a personal copy
   - Run cells, edit cells, restart runtime
3. **Python warmup (10–15 min)**
   - Basic variables, lists, loops, and random selection for ideation
4. **First ML interaction (15–20 min)**
   - Run and modify a toy classification example
   - Connect to core terms: model, training, inference, bias, generalization
5. **Reflection + debrief (10 min)**
   - Notebook markdown reflection and short group discussion

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this hands-on segment, students can:

- Open and run a Google Colab notebook
- Edit markdown and code cells
- Execute and tweak a minimal ML example
- Document one limitation and one creative use case

### Your task

One completed notebook including:

- At least 3 executed code cells
- At least 2 markdown reflection cells
- 1 saved output artifact (text, table, or image)
